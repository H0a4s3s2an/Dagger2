		Do you think the manual or pure Dependency Injection will be an effective solution?. I think you
		agree with me that this is not effective anymore. Because in a large project, you will need to
		handle many dependency creations by yourself. Also, the object creation may be very complex,
		and you do not need to recreate them every time. So I will need a framework that handles this
		creation and remove the boilerplate code. Sometimes you will need scope or object lifetime for
		the specific feature, not the whole app, to come to the scene.
